The Personalized Health Plan Recommender System is designed to suggest the most suitable health insurance plans for users based on their personal demographics, health history, lifestyle factors, and financial preferences. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this system analyzes complex user data to offer tailored recommendations, ensuring that users are matched with insurance plans that meet their needs and budget.

Technical Approach:

Data Preprocessing:
User data, including categorical features such as age, health conditions, and lifestyle choices, is preprocessed using one-hot encoding. This encoding transforms categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning models, ensuring that each category is represented uniquely for better model performance.

Clustering with K-Means:
K-means clustering is employed to group users with similar health profiles and preferences. The algorithm partitions users into clusters based on features like age, health status, and lifestyle, ensuring that users with similar needs are grouped together. Each cluster represents a segment of users with comparable insurance preferences, helping the system identify patterns and common traits within those groups.

Plan Matching and Recommendation:
After clustering, health insurance plans are matched to each user based on their cluster characteristics. Plans with coverage and pricing similar to the needs of a given cluster are recommended, ensuring personalized suggestions that align with the user's unique profile. The clustering approach allows for a more nuanced recommendation process, optimizing for both coverage needs and cost-effectiveness.

User Interface:
The system provides an intuitive interface where users can input their details and receive a list of recommended insurance plans. The plans are ranked based on their suitability for the user's cluster, along with key information on coverage, premiums, and potential out-of-pocket expenses.
